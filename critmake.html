				<h4 class ="styled text-justify">Critical Making was a workshop organized by the DoIIIT Lab at the University of Michigan school of information as a 24-hr hackathon. <br><br>The theme of the workshop was to allow participants to critically reflect on body politics, health, culture, bio-hacking and personal informatics and to create a tangible design product.<br><br>The Workshop was also facilitated by emminent personalities such as  Leah Buechley (creator of the LilyPad Arduino and former MIT professor), Sophia Brueckner (Assistant professor at the Stamps school of art & design and also previously at MIT), Erik Hofer (UMSI’s CIO and a clinical assistant professor) as well as Nick Tobier (Professor at Stamps and founder of a Detroit makerspace). <br><br></h4>

We had to fit in our design process in the limited time of 24 hrs which includes brainstorming, identifying the critical intervention, understanding the technology and prototyping. Obviously the biggest constrain was confronting with failures at every stage of prototyping but still we were able to prototype our design.<br><br></h4>

<h4 class ="styled text-justify">The user can also add reverb and other effects to the music using the gyroscope inbuilt in the smartphone. An independent mobile application such as AndOSC or TouchOSC can stream the Gyro and other sensor values as OSC signals over the WIFI to a computer. The gyro values are then captured using a library in python called the PyOSC. These values are used to control the reverb and other audio effects by changing the value of decay, feedback and other parameters that determines the effect being created.<br><br></h4>

				<h2 class="styledMedium">Panel Feedback</h2><br><br><br>
				<h4 class ="styled text-justify">The interaction is straightforward with the instrument. The user must hold the device using both handles and pluck the tines to create digital music. While doing so the user can move the device up and down or shake it in a rhythmic pattern to generate musical effects on the generated music. This effect can be controlled by how fast and by what angle the device is translated from its initial position. The instrument is not tethered to the device and hence the user is not constrained by any physical movements with regards to his orientation in space while interacting with the device. The only constraint would be the affordance of the instrument itself which as per Lian (Lian Loke and Toni Robertson. 2008) is the best way to create and device methods of interaction and experience.</h4> <br><br>

            <h4 class ="styled white text-justify">As far as the future goal of this project is concerned, there are two apparent modifications to be made to the design and working of the prototype. Firstly, the prototype needs to be made smaller and needs to be build using real instrument grade materials. Second, the processing can be offloaded from remote machine to an app that can run on any smartphone. This transforms the way users use the device by creating, synthesizing and mixing music using instruments on top of the smartphone. The fact that these can run on smartphones opens an entire spectrum of the user’s ability to share the music to other applications, and store files on the cloud.</h4><br><br>
