However, a growing concern is that most of the women at large are unaware about the Laws and Legislations that are available to protect them, particularly in developing nations where there is a burst of population and technology.

A SWOT analysis of the various services and features was performed to identify what worked and what did not work for these services. Based on the features the applications were rated on a scale of 5, based on the "ease of access" and "Usefulness of the features". <br><br>Further, since most of these applications were already in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, the user reviews was a key indicator of the features the users liked and hated<br><br></h4>

                <br><br><h4 class ="styled text-justify"> Following the discovery phase, I started sketching out alternative solutions that focusses on the design problem guided by my design philosophy. At this stage my only source of user research was through the initial discovery phase and hence I was aware that my sketches were not devoid of "Designer's Assumptions". Accepting this fact made me think broadly and outside the consumer product domain. <br><br>Shown below is a picture of the initial sketch depicting 8 unique solutions that shaped my design focus in future iterations.<br><br></h4>

                    <h4 class="styled text-justify">The 8 sketches were further explored by creating user storyboards. Again, the principle of minimal interactions and ease of access was explored while creating the user stories. Each story contains a minimum of 5 sketches which equals to a total of 40 sketches. Once these sketches were made, the sketches were shown to a peer critique group to receive feedback on the ideas and feasibility of implementation.<br><br> Shown on the left is the comprehensive user storyboard sketches created.<br><br><br></h4></div>

                <h4 class="styled text-justify">Key to any successful UX Design is to know the users and their needs. No two users are alike consequently their needs are different as well. It is important to identify the different types of target users and to create a persona that defines this subset of user group. For this Design, I identified 4 Personas and 1 Ant-Persona for whom the design would fail. The 4 Personas were created having in mind their Motivations, frustrations and Goals. <br><br>Creating different personas shed light on the various stakeholders involved and also helped me in identifying the most important stakeholder. The Anti-Persona played a key role by reminding me throughout as to whom this solution is not for.</h4><br>

                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">User Interviews</h4>
                <h4 class="styled text-justify">After defining the various stakeholder involved it was time to interview a few of these user groups and ask them open-ended questions to allow for a holistic evaluation of the needs and assumptions. Many of these questions were situational and was framed in a way to understand the user's mentality and emotional behaviour. Few questions were also asked to describe their involvement in preventing sexual-harassment and other social engagements.</h4><br>

                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">Learnings from User Interviews</h4>
                <h4 class="styled text-justify">Interacting with the target users at this stage of the design process was important for me to focus on specifics of the interactions and functionalities. The following are few of the learnings from the Interviews: <br><br>
                1) Many are apprehensive about using defensive technologies such as pepper sprays and taser guns.<br>
                2) Users don't want external devices that needs to be charged regularly.<br>
                3) Many users prefer to use mobile applications rather than purchasing external devices that can be worn in the wrist/ring.<br>
                4) Users also felt bad about situations where many incidents go unreported and their efforts to make them public go unrewarded<br>
                5) Finaly, many users agreed that they do not use similar applications since they trigger a lot of false alarms and send broadcast signals unwantedly to friends and family<br> </h4>

                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">Brainstorming with the Target Users</h4>
                <h4 class="styled text-justify">Following the interview, a brief brainstorming session was held with the target users and evaluated the design sketches previously made to get a sense of their emotional reactions to the proposed solutions. This activity revealed the features that the users want and liked and the user critiques helped me to negate all my assumptions at the start. Now I had a clear understanding of the needs and the features that the users would like to see in the final product (Yes, a mobile application)</h4>

				<h4 class="styledStrong text-justify">Wireframing</h4>
				<h4 class ="styled text-justify">The next step was to create wireframes and design the UI and interactions of the mobile applications. Now I started thinking about the various features that needs to be incorporated in the application buttressing on the user research and interviews conducted. Once all critical features were identified it was time to think about the interactions and the placement of those UI elements. It was a crucial step to think through the design of the UI since the number of interactions and the time taken to access the critical features is a very vital resource to be considered for this design problem. <br><br> The pictures on the left are few wireframe mockups of the prototype hinting at the features supported in the final design.</h4></div>

                <h4 class="styledStrong text-justify">Paper Prototyping</h4>
				<h4 class ="styled text-justify">It was time to test the wireframes with target users by using lo-fidelity paper mockups and prototype. The paper prototype was tested with 3 target users and 2 general audience to get a holistic view about the interactions and usability. Each participant was given a task to perform without any guidance. The user interactions and the body language was noted to understand the UI conflicts and concerns.</h4> <br><br>

                <h4 class ="styled text-justify">This feature is at the heart of the application and assists the user in finding nearby safe locations by pulling location information from social media such as Facebook, Google+, Instagram e.t.c. The location is then visualized on a map along with a listing of nearby public locations and police stations. Selecting a friend's location displays options to call, text and navigate to that location.<br><br>
                    The key differentiator that is unique to this application is the aggregation of data from various social networking sites to prive a holistic view of available resources to the target users.<br>
                    Another added feature is the availability of battery-saver mode built into the application that toggles the map-view to text view when the battery is low or drops below 15%.<br></h4>

                    <h4 class ="styled text-justify">This feature had the most apparent makeover after the user testing in the lo-fidelity prototype. Initially the feature was hidden inside the "find a safe place" option but after incorporating the feedback from user testing and peer critiques, I made the feature accessible from the landing screen.<br><br>
                    The choice of having a slider instead of a button was to arrive at a design solution that is easy to use and at the same time reduces false triggers. The sliders also go along with the native design of the ios. This was by far the best UX design solution I arrived at to tackle the problem of "false triggers" which surfaced from the user reasearch and discovery phase.<br><br></h4></div>
