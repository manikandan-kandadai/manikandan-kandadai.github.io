									<span class="icon major fa-globe"></span>
									<h3>Scale of Problem</h3>
									<p>Stalking and sexual harassment is a global problem for women and men alike. The #MeToo movement reached 85 Countries with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metoo-reaches-85-countries-with-1-7-million-tweets/" target="_blank"><b>1.7M Tweets</b></a></p>

								<img src="images/rakshaa/Research.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;border-radius:5px ">
<br><br><h3 class="subhead">How?</h3>
								<p>A Market research was performed to identify <b>solutions currently available in the market</b> dealing with women safety. Research was performed on mobile, web and physical products available in the market.

A <b>SWOT analysis</b> of the various services and features was performed <b>to identify opportunities</b> and features that would make up the value proposition for the application.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Learning?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The Competitive Analysis helped me figure out the <b>missed opportunities</b> in the market</li>
									<li>The <b>User Reviews</b> in the App store helped me <b>perform a preliminarily need assessment and emotion coding</b> </li>
									<li><b>False positives were a major deterrent</b> for the users to use the application - threats</li>

<h3># Interviews</h3>
<section class="Rakshaainterview" >
	<img src="images/rakshaa/interview.png" alt="" class="interviewImg" >
	<div class="interviewText" ><br>
		<h3 class="subhead">Why?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>To understand the <b>needs, emotions and personal</b> experience of the users</li>
			<li>To evaluate their <b>current</b> choice of <b>solution</b></li>
			<li>To <b>define a problem</b> in the voice of the user</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="subhead">Findings</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Stalking occurs all the time</b> as opposed to my perception of the occurance being concentrated at night.
<li>Most of the users carry a <b>pepper spray</b> but are <b>afraid to use</b> them because they feel that the situation might escalate or they might be wrong about the person
</li>
<li><b>Current solutions</b> in the market are <b>hard to use</b> and has many false triggers
</li>
<li>An ideal solution does not exist. Many felt that to completely stop stalking, a <b>combined effort of social responsibility, law enforcement and technology should be in place</b>
</li>
<li>Users felt <b>indifferent towards a wearable</b> or other devices that needs to be charged to be carried around in addition to their mobile devices</li>
		</ul>
	</div>



</section>
<br><br>
<h3># Personas</h3>
<p>Following the interviews, I created <b>5 personas and 1 anti-persona</b> to help personify the problem from a user's context. This also helped me in viewing the problem from the point of view of various stake holders.

I also created an anti-persona to be cognizant of the type of users who will not be using this application.</p>

<h3 ># Sketching</h3>
<section>
	<p>
		Taking the results of the secondary research further, <b>I sketched 8 unique ideas creating digital and physical solutions to the problem definition </b>which was later iterated and presented to the target users and other designers to get some feedback on.
	</p>
<p>The <b>objective</b> of this excersise was <b>to come up with multiple unique solutions to solve the problem without any constraints</b> or validating any assumptions. This excersise can be thought as a moodboard for further iteration and validation where ideas were later eliminated after feedback from users.</p>

	<h3 ># Storyboards & Interaction Walkthroughs</h3>

	<p>
		The <b>8 concepts where developed further to illustrate a user story</b>. Each storyboard consists of a minimum of 5 sketches/steps adding up to <b>40 sketches in total</b>. The storyboard is a simplified user journey map illustrating how the users will use the solution.
		</p>
		<p>The <b>objective</b> of this activity was <b>to get a glimpse of the User Experience</b> even before prototyping solutions. This activity also accentuated how crazy few solutions were to be practical.

	<h3 ># Participatory Design & Feedback</h3>
<br>
<h3 class="subhead">Why this?</h3>
	<p>
Now that the target users, problem statement and initial brainstorming is done, it is time to get some feedback from the users by showing them the sketches. I
took the approach of a participatory design exercise with the users so that <b>they felt comfortable selecting ideas and working with me</b> to make changes they felt was needed.

<h3 class="subhead">The Value of this exercise?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When users started to design along with me, they felt <b>comfortable talking about features they liked and hated</b></li>
	<li>Card sorting excersise at the end helped me in <b>understanding the mental model</b> of the users and their expectations</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subhead">What did I learn?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The users felt that a <b>dedicated wearable devices</b> are either left behind at home or is <b>not ideal</b> due to <b>extra steps involved</b> in charging and maintaining the device.</li>
	<li>A wearable device also means that it needs to <b>replace existing devices</b> the users might already have (Eg. Apple watch, Fitbit, etc)</li>
	<li>Preferred a mobile application that is easy to use and have functionalites that do not trigger false alerts often</li>
