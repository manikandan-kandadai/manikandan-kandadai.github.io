                <h4 class="styledStrong text-justify">About the Workshop:</h4>
				<h4 class ="styled text-justify">Critical Making was a workshop organized by the DoIIIT Lab at the University of Michigan school of information as a 24-hr hackathon. <br><br>The theme of the workshop was to allow participants to critically reflect on body politics, health, culture, bio-hacking and personal informatics and to create a tangible design product.<br><br>The Workshop was also facilitated by emminent personalities such as  Leah Buechley (creator of the LilyPad Arduino and former MIT professor), Sophia Brueckner (Assistant professor at the Stamps school of art & design and also previously at MIT), Erik Hofer (UMSI’s CIO and a clinical assistant professor) as well as Nick Tobier (Professor at Stamps and founder of a Detroit makerspace). <br><br></h4>

				<h2 class="styledMedium">Constraints</h2><br><br><br>
				<h4 class ="styled text-justify">The team was constrained with 24- hrs of time and limited resources in terms of available electronics and sensors to work with. We had to fit in our design process in the limited time of 24 hrs which includes brainstorming, identifying the critical intervention, understanding the technology and prototyping. Obviously the biggest constrain was confronting with failures at every stage of prototyping but still we were able to prototype our design.<br><br></h4>

				<h2 class="styledMedium">Design</h2><br><br><br>
                <h4 class ="styled text-justify">The workshop was organized to work around the constraints as described above. Every team was given the freedom to invent their own process and make use of that process as the framework.<br><br>We as a team decided to tweak the general process of design thinking to work with critical making by giving importance to emotions as being an integral part of user's needs in the process. We also wanted to create something that critically evaluates the emotions that we are interested in. <br><br>For this workshop our Design Mantra was <b>"Design for the Emotions"</b><br><br></h4><br><br>
                
                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">Brainstorming</h4>
                <h4 class ="styled text-justify">The first step of the process was to ideate as much as possible as a group and arrive at a consensus and identify the problem that we were critically evaluating. <br><br>The group as a whole decided on critically reflecting on the social behaviour of humans and their emotions. We wanted to critically reflect on the idea of shared emotions in digital space.<br><br>In this digital world, every person is enmeshed in a vortex of technology that it has made it hard for an average person to be in contact with another without social media which simulates fake emotions using emoticons. We wanted to quantify emotions and share this across people irrespective of their geo-location.</h4><br><br>
                
                
                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">Critical Analysis</h4>
                <h4 class ="styled text-justify">Having decided on our topic we started to critically evaluate the way social media is approaching emotions. For instance, Facebook introduced emotions as an alternative response for "liking" a post on the user wall. Instagram has "hearts" to like a post. Other social media has also tried to incorporate emotions in their own way. But we identified a large gap in the way social media approaches emotions and we wanted to create a more quantifiable and real way to share emotions among people. <br><br>For our project, we wanted to bridge the gap between people who are located at different locations and are in need of being in an emotional contact with each other. We created "EmoteGlove" as a part of this intervention with the aim to transfer emotions that are quantifiable across boarders.<br><br></h4>
                
                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">Working</h4>
                <h4 class ="styled text-justify">At this point we knew that we needed a way to transmit emotions from a person seeking it and the person sending it. It was also apparent to us that we needed 2 versions of the gloves to make this work between the two.<br><br></h4>
                
                <img src="img/experiments/crit/working.png" width="100%" style="margin:auto;"/><br><br>
                <h4 class ="styled text-justify">The prototype we arrived at consisted of two models of the gloves in which the person who needs some emotional support (Person A) has an EMG sensor that monitors for anxiety and emotional disturbances and sends request to Person B as a vibration. The Person B then clutches his hand and sends a signal wirelessly to Person A that warms up his palm using a heatpad that's inside Person A's gloves.<br><br>
                
                <h4 class="styledStrong text-left">Technology</h4>
                    <h4 class ="styled text-justify">We used Arduino's, Lillypads, few active sensors and photon for wireless communication. <br><br></h4><div class="col-md-12"><h4 class ="styled text-justify"><b>The Transmitter: </b><br>The Transmitter consists of the glove with heatpads attached inside the glove. An external EMG sensor was also attached to the arm of the person to capture muscle signals that vary based on skin conductance and anxiousness. This signal is transmitted using photon wirelessly to the receiver.<br><br>
                    <b>The Receiver: </b><br>
                    The receiver also has a glove with flex sensors attached that changes the voltage based on the how much it is bent. A wrist band on this person vibrates if it receives any emotion requests. The Person B then clutches his hand in response to the received notification. He bends the flex sensor and this signal is transmitted using photon to the actual sender and heats up the heated on Person A's palm.
