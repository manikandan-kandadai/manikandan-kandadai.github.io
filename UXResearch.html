                            <h2>Challenges</h2>
                            

                            <p>
								At RSA, I worked on an enterprise product - the RSA NetWitness Platform. This is a web-based SIEM (Security information and event management) application. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Conducting UX Research has not been easy as there were some challenges and constraints given the nature of the product.
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li>The product is used by highly skilled professionals who have varying degrees of experience working in the security industry.</li>
									<li>Not all cybersecurity professionals are our users. Our users are essentially only our customers.</li>
									<li>Recruiting users for usability testing sessions has been challenging as direct access to customers was not available.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							To circumvent these challenges and constraints, I employed a mixed-method for usability sessions I conducted. The mixed-methods helped us get the most feedback in a limited time.
							
							<p>
								<br><br>
								Depending on the research timeline, we either work with actual users or rely on our internal SME’s who work closely with our customers. The SME’s are Sales Engineers or Professional services who specialize in certain product areas.

							<h2>Process & Methods</h2>
<br>

<h3 ># Usability Testing</h3>
<p>
	After coming up with a testing script, I conducted usability sessions with 5-7 users or SME for every project. This might not sound like having many participants, but, given the timeline and time taken to schedule sessions with our customers, this was good enough to get a sense of user behavior and identify usability quirks in the designs.
</p>
<section>
<br>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
    
    <div style="flex-basis: 60%; margin-right: 10px;">
        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>
            In order to make the best use of the sessions, I modified the Usability Testing to be a mixed methodology.

            We decided to do Usability testings combined with interviews and some exploratory research in a single session.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
				Usability testing with tasks and following up with clarifying questions was the method we embraced as that gave us both quantitative and qualitative metrics. 
            </li>
            <li>
				Since we don’t conduct a real AB testing due to resource constraints, we baked that into usability testing by having multiple design options and asking users to walk us through those options and provide feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
				Sometimes based on the time we have left, we made incremental changes to designs if we started to see a pattern during usability sessions. We validated those changes with the remaining sessions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
			This process helped us be very efficient in identifying about 80-85% of usability issues in the designs under a timeline that worked for the scrum teams and us. The rest 15% was acknowledged and taken into consideration for incremental updates in future releases.            </p>
        <p>
            I typically conducted the usability sessions and have a Designer/ Project Manager/Product Owner in the call to listen in and answer some clarifying questions that the users/SME may have.
        </p>
        <p>
			After the session concludes, I go over the recorded sessions to identify themes and share the insights as a report to the Designer, PM, and Scrum teams. 
        </p>

<h3 ># UX Analytics</h3>
<section>
<br>
<p>
    The usability session was useful to validate design ideas and feature-specific usability questions. For a while, we could not track UX metrics and telemetry in the product. This was partly due to the product being on-premises and not on the cloud. Recently RSA invested in Pendo analytics that provided us with much-needed telemetry data to understand how users navigate the product. This is optional, and users can opt-out if they prefer.</p>
<p>
    Pendo helped us understand the most common path users take in the application and the most used features in the product. These metrics allowed us to validate if the design changes we were making are improving user experience. Pendo also helps us understand if we are making the right investments in the product from behavioral analytics.
</p>
<p>
    Since we started using Pendo relatively recently, In the future, we hope to combine usability sessions with the metrics from Pendo to make more informed product decisions and investments.

<p>
    We also conducted Surveys using survey monkey to get feedback from customers and did a few card sorting exercises to validate the Information Architecture.

				<section>
					<h3 ># Working with the data</h3>
					<br>

                    <p>
						Being the only UX Researcher on the team, I soon ran into the problem of managing the research and putting it all in a place for sharing.                     </p>
                    <p>
						I used Airtable and Apple notes to manage notes and research. To share research, I uploaded documents and video sessions on one drive and shared research notes and reports on the wiki (Atlassian confluence), which is used by the entire product team.
                    </p>
